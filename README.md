Introduction
Machine learning is a rapidly growing field with a wide range of algorithms and techniques. This repository aims to showcase my implementations of popular machine learning algorithms. By exploring the code and accompanying documentation, you can gain a better understanding of how these algorithms work and how they can be applied to real-world problems.

Algorithms
The repository currently includes implementations of the following machine learning algorithms:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Naive Bayes
K-Means Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Neural Networks
Each algorithm implementation is contained within its own directory, which includes the necessary code files and documentation to understand and use the algorithm effectively.

Usage
To use any of the machine learning algorithms in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone 
Navigate to the directory of the desired algorithm implementation.

Follow the instructions provided in the README file within the algorithm's directory to understand the prerequisites, dependencies, and usage details specific to that algorithm.

Explore the code, experiment with different datasets, and adapt the algorithm implementation to suit your needs.

Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you would like to contribute your own implementations of machine learning algorithms, please follow these steps:
